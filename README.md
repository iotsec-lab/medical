## Overview
This repository is intended to provide documentation on the dataset.

This dataset contains .pcap files which makeup the device activity for 8 medical devices: Sense-U BabyMonitor, EarWax Device, FitBitFitness, GuardianAlert . Each .pcapng file contains a single packet and has been cleaned of ip/mac addresses and the checksums have been recomputed. This was done to anonymize the data and remove information which may simplify the task of classification.
